# passwordgenerator
Description
-----------

This project's main purpose is to generate random passwords. A Password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user
provides when prompted.

when the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first prompted for password length. If outside the
range 8 -128, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop
until the user enters a valid number.

The program prompts the user to define if they would like to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters.
If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

when all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
